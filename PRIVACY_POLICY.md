## Particle Flow: Privacy Policy

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
All the data (e.g. number of particles, colors, etc.) used by this app and set/modified by you (the user) is visible from the Settings menu and is stored on your device only. It can easily be erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Nicolas Faralli.
